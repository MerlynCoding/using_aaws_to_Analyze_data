Analyzing Data on AWS S3 and Cloud9

In this tutorial, we will explore how to manage data stored on AWS S3 using Cloud9, ensuring data integrity and consistency throughout the process. Let's dive in!

## Step 1: Data Generation

We generate data for a period of one month, spanning from September 25th to October 22nd, resulting in a total of 672 data points. Each day contributes 24 data points, totaling 672 data points over the entire period.

## Step 2: Storing Data on S3

We store the generated data in an AWS S3 bucket, providing a reliable and scalable storage solution. With approximately 672 data files uploaded to S3, our data is securely stored in the cloud.

## Step 3: Cloud9 Data Verification

Using Cloud9, we verify the integrity of our data stored in S3. As S3 updates may not always reflect immediately, Cloud9 provides a convenient environment to inspect the total number of files. Upon inspection, we confirm the presence of 672 data files, ensuring that our data remains intact.

## Step 4: Data Import Verification

After importing the data, we perform another verification step using Cloud9 to ensure the accuracy of the imported data. By confirming the total number of files, which remains at 672, we validate that the data import process was successful without any discrepancies.

## Step 5: Data Download and Size Confirmation

To conclude our data management process, we download a subset of the data and verify its size to ensure consistency. By downloading and inspecting the data, we confirm that the file sizes match our expectations, further validating the integrity of our data throughout the entire process.

Congratulations! You have successfully managed and verified data stored on AWS S3 using Cloud9, ensuring reliability and consistency at every step. Happy data management! üöÄüîç
